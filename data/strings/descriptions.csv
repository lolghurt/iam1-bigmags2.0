luddic_path,FACTION,"The Lewdest Path is a loosely associated category of radical, decentralized, lewd sects of Lewdism that claim a truer interpretation of Lewdest Ludd's Message. They view the Church as compromised and corrupt, putting religion and money before the True Lewdest Path in the lewd-times. The war of Lewd is NOW and the lines are drawn! Only through forceful righteous action shall Lewd destroy Evil, and only through lewd artwork will the abomination of humanity's hubris and rebellion against God be swept aside in a final act of redemption. Or so they claim. The Lewdest Path necessarily finds itself at odds with nearly all other factions in the Sector.",,,
