Special Modifications,andrada_mods,,,,dmod,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.hullmods.AndradaMods,"During an inspection of an early prototype, the Supreme Executor was heard to comment unfavorably on exposed conduits running along the passageways, and the danger these must pose to the brave and loyal crew under combat conditions. 

The new chief designer, a loyal officer appointed by the Supreme Executor himself, instructed the forge-programmers make accommodations for the installation of special blast-proof insulated paneling produced by Sindria itself.

If the passages are a bit narrower, conduits prone to overheating, and flush-set panels somewhat unwieldy to access, the official readiness reports include no criticism of the changes. Everyone agrees in both public and - as the Internal Security Ministry can attest - in private, that the stark grandeur of the Lion's Guard fleet is breathtaking.

Crew casualties in combat are increased by %s. The base flux dissipation rate is reduced by %s, and the repair rate for disabled weapons and engines is reduced by %s.",Reduces the ship's performance.,,graphics/hullmods/special_modifications.png
